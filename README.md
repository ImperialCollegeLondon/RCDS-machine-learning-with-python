# Machine Learning with Python

*Getting started with scikit-learn*

## Self-study Instructions

This series of notebooks will get you started with applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods in Python, using the popular `scikit-learn` package.

## Intended Learning Outcomes

After completing this workshop, you will be better able to:

* Prepare a dataset for machine learning in Python
* Select a scikit-learn method appropriate for a particular learning task
* Construct your own workflows for model training and testing
* Evaluate the performance of a model

## Setup

We will be working with python using jupyter notebooks. The easiest way to access jupyter is via the Anaconda platform.

Please install Anaconda from <https://www.anaconda.com> in advance of the first session.

Please ensure that you have an up-to-date scikit-learn package installed prior to starting the first session.
General installation instructions are available here:
<https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html#installation-instructions>

scikit-learn is part of the default installation of Anaconda, so you may already have everything you need.

## Getting Started

Download this repository to your computer as a ZIP file and unpack it.

Open JupyterLab (within Anaconda) and navigate to the unpacked directory to work with the .ipynb notebooks.

Alternatively, you can run the notebooks online using Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ImperialCollegeLondon/RCDS-machine-learning-with-python/StatML?urlpath=lab)

Work through the notebooks at your own pace. When you feel that you understand the basic concepts of scikit-learn, you should complete the Final Exam notebook and send a copy of the notebook to your course administrator.
